<arg1>at the moment, however, the painting is a nagging reminder of the problems that have engulfed centrust and its flamboyant chairman and chief executive, david l. paul</arg1><arg2>in an international buying spree that began barely two years ago, mr. paul amassed a collection of about 30 pre-18th-century works, including the preti, at a total cost of $28 million. 

by midnight oct. 6, all of the paintings were supposed to have been sold off, under orders from florida's comptroller, whose office regulates the state's s&ls.
centrust didn't meet the deadline. 

the collection was at the heart of a grandiose plan mr. paul had in which the art was to do double duty -- as an investment for centrust and as decoration for the s&l's new office tower, designed by i.m. pei.
the rub is that the $28 million was plucked from the funds of this federally insured institution even as centrust was losing money hand over fist.
mr. paul had no right to buy art for the s&l in the first place -- it isn't on the comptroller's ""permissible"" list -- without seeking a special dispensation, which he did not do.
besides that, some of the paintings that were to grace the walls of centrust actually ended up hanging in the chairman's estate on la gorce isle off miami beach</arg2>
